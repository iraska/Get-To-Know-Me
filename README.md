I have a bachelor's degree in Nutrition and Dietetics, as well as continuing my associate degree in Cookery. I am also a Creative Drama Instructor. My passions include traveling, creating fiction and playing in the theatre. I actively practice Yoga and Meditation. I aim to develop games, educational content and animations with AR / VR by blending all my skills and knowledge.*
